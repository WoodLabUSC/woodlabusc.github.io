      <h3><em>in-vivo</em> Measurements of Iron Using MRI</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia major require chronic blood transfusions. These blood transfusions, while life-saving, also provide an abundance of iron, for which the human body has no efficient method of excreting. Thus, excess iron accumulates in the body and becomes toxic, resulting in early death. The development of drugs call chelators perform the task of removing the excess iron from the body. When taken as directed, chelators can effectively eliminate iron to non-toxic levels. However, administration of these drugs is often complicated, cumbersome and requires diligent compliance.</p>
        <p>Conventional monitoring of the body's iron stores consists of blood lab tests and liver biopsy, as the blood and liver are the primary sites for iron storage. However, the body also stores iron in spleen, bone marrow, pancreas, and most importantly the heart. The heart deserves particular attention because  heart failure is the number one cause of death in thalassemia major patients with iron overload. We and others have observed increased incidence of cardiac abnormalities with iron deposition in the heart. The heart can contain toxic levels of iron, even when the liver shows well-controlled levels or iron. Whereas the liver is readily accessible for biopsy, the heart is not an ideal organ for biopsy.</p>
        <p>MRI is the ideal instrument for measuring the body's iron stores. It is sensitive to iron, can make measurements throughout the body in any position, and is widely available. MRI uses no radiation, and the only patients that are prohibited from receiving the exam are those with a pacemaker or other magnetic implant or stimulator. Using MRI, we currently perform comprehensive assessments of body iron and heart function. This consists of measuring the liver iron, heart iron, and heart function, all within a one-hour exam. With these measurements, hematologists can monitor and adjust the patient's treatment regimens.</p>
        <p>There still exists an abundance of work to be done in clarifying the mechanisms of iron deposition and excretion in the human, mechanisms of various chelation treatments, and standardizing the measurement methods and analysis. </p>

      <h3>Congenital Heart Disease</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>At Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, we see a large number of unusual and rare cases of congenital heart disease. Drs. John Wood and Grace Kung perform MRI as a clinical diagnostic tool in guiding physicians in their pre- and post-op assessments. The most common referrals are for Tetralogy of Fallot (monitoring RV/LV EF and PA assessments), coarctations (visualization and regurgitant fraction), and vascular rings. In some cases, we are able to provide MRI as an alternative to catheterization.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Facilities</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>All MRI exams are currently performed on a GE 1.5T CVi system, in the Department of Radiology. </p>
